Bitcoin Ticker
==============

What?
-----

A little Chrome extension, tapping into the APIs of Bitcoin traders, to keep you up to date with the latest prices.

I made this a while ago, mostly for my self, then packaged it up as I thought it might be useful to others. Some of the traders that this is set up for have now either been hacked, gone out of business, or changed their APIs since then, so this is in need of a bit of maintenance. I may do it shortly, but in the mean time, feel free to jump in!

Why?
----

So you can keep an eye on prices in a discreet but convenient way.

Where?
------

Get it here on Github, or add it from the Chrome WebStore

How?
----

Add the unpacked source by visiting `chrome://extensions/` in Chrome / Chromium.

Or click on the "ADD TO CHROME" link on the webstore page.
